Libre Duel was originally conceived because there were several features that Breter and I thought could really benefit Bridge Duel, but the owner refused to add. The earliest record I have of this is on 2025 June 27, though I think the actual conception date was probably around a month earlier.

I also realised it would be a good idea because I love [FOSS](<https://opensource.org/osd>).

At some point I realised it would be cool how Bridge Duel would have two editions: Proprietary and Libre, just like Minecraft has Java and Bedrock.

When Bridge Duel got taken down, a new reason emerged: Libre Duel would now be the *only* variant of Bridge Duel available. The hope is that this game will be different enough to not warrant a takedown.
