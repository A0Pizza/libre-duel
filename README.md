# <img src="./images/icon_small.svg" alt="Libre Duel icon" width="30"/> Libre Duel

Libre Duel was originally conceived because there were several features that Breter and I thought could really benefit Bridge Duel, but the owner refused to add. The earliest record I have of this is on 2025 June 27, though I think the actual conception date was probably around a month earlier.

I also realised it would be a good idea because I love [FOSS](<https://opensource.org/osd>).

At some point I realised it would be cool how Bridge Duel would have two editions: Proprietary and Libre, just like Minecraft has Java and Bedrock.

When Bridge Duel got taken down, a new reason emerged: Libre Duel would now be the *only* variant of Bridge Duel available. The hope is that this game will be different enough to not warrant a takedown.

## Development

See: <https://github.com/EliTheGingerCat/roblox-build-tools?tab=readme-ov-file#only-for-me>

Though, I am going to have to come up with an actual solution for this since this project has a decent chance of receiving contributions from random people.

I want to follow this: <https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>
